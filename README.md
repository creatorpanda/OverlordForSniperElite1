# Overlord For Sniper Elite 1
An attempt to recreate a stable and self-sustainable version of the [legendary **Spotter for Sniper Elite**](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Legendary%20Spotter.png) from scratch.

### A journal where I record the progress of my biggest, most complicated project ever.

**Warning:** *I won't upload the program's code throughout the process. I don't know if I ever will or not. This is just the official page where someone can find information for the Overlord in case I ever manage to publish a functional piece of software. All the downloads, upgrades, updates and news regarding everything that concerns the proejct will be posted here.*

#### ***next README.md update in less than 9 hours.***
~#### To be announced:~
- ~Overlord's abilities I've accomplished so far.~
- ~Overlord's abilities I'm currently working on.~
- ~Overlord's overall abilities.~

*will eventually do*

### Update #1, Wednesday 29/4/2020 (delayed cause I couldn't stop sleeping all day) 

I've been working on the Overlord for some days. Mostly studying IP harvesting and manipulation. Currently, the Overlord looks like this:

![Overlord for Sniper Elite 1](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Overlord3.png)

Things I'll try to finish until next update

- [x] complete Interface (only "Main Display" for now)

- [x] carefully create variables for software needs.  

- ~[ ] saving IPs in logs~

- ~[ ] proper actions when X button is pressed~

- ~[ ] proper events log functionality~

- ~[ ] proper event log export (including usernames and banned usernames for now)~

(ticking things when done, before the next update)

### Update #2, Wednesday 6/5/2020 (disappointing)
(**R.I.P. [Florian Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Schneider)**) 

I made no important progress. It's going to take a while until I'm ready to continue on the IP matter. I finished the "Main Display" GUI, all the variables needed, and now I'm focusing on the network capabilities of the program. I believe unless I finish that, nothing else can be accomplished. Finally, created a dark mode because I enjoy dark-themed programs. I like it, but it doesn't serve the main purpose of the Overlord. Here's what I made:

*I have no plans until the next update. I'll use some quality time to study what i need to elarn before I continue.*
Quarantine makes everything difficult + semester is coming. Pray for me.
