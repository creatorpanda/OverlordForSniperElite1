# Overlord For Sniper Elite 1
Recreating from scratch, a stable and self-sustainable version of the [legendary **Spotter for Sniper Elite**](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Legendary%20Spotter.png).

### A journal where I record the progress of my biggest, most complicated project ever.

**Note:** *I won't be uploading the program's code throughout the process. I don't know if I ever will or not. This is **the official page** where someone can find information **for Overlord** in case I ever manage to publish a functional piece of software. All the downloads, upgrades, updates and news regarding everything that concerns the proejct will be posted here.*

# Progress Updates


### Update #1, Wednesday 29/4/2020 (the beginning)

I've been working on the Overlord for some days. Mostly studying IP harvesting and manipulation. Currently, the Overlord looks like this:

![Overlord for Sniper Elite 1](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Overlord3.png)

Things I'll try to finish until next update

- [x] complete Interface (only "Main Display" for now)

- [x] carefully create variables for software needs.  

- ~[ ] saving IPs in logs~

- ~[ ] proper actions when X button is pressed~

- ~[ ] proper events log functionality~

- ~[ ] proper event log export (including usernames and banned usernames for now)~

I strikethrough'd some points cause I realized the load of work they need to be accomplished. I couldn't get these ready in 7 days. I'n not that good at programming *yet*..

### Update #2, Wednesday 6/5/2020 (dark theme)
(**R.I.P. [Florian Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Schneider)**) 

I made no important progress. It's going to take a while until I'm ready to continue on the IP matter. I finished the "Main Display" GUI, all the variables needed, and now I'm focusing on the network capabilities of the program. I believe unless I finish that, nothing else can be accomplished. Finally, created a dark mode because I enjoy dark-themed programs. I like it, but it doesn't serve the main purpose of the Overlord. Here's what I made:

*I have no plans until the next update. I'll use some quality time to study what i need to learn before I continue.*
Quarantine makes everything difficult + semester is coming. Pray for me.

### Update #3, Sunday 31/5/2020 (where I've been)
(**R.I.P. [George Perry Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd)**)

It's been a while since the date I was supposed to report my progress and even more since the last update.
Truth is that studies for uni (business and tourism management) and other courses I've taken, monopolize my time.
Plus, my 11 years old desktop eventually became unreliable. Most probably a motherboard malfunction caused by corrosion that messes up RAM slots. That of course ruins stability and proper functioning of the machine, so I decided to put my desktop to rest and only use my laptop from now on. The **Overlord for Sniper Elite 1** project is safely waiting for me to extract it, in one of the desktop's drives.

**Note:** *I studied my previous updates and realized that I'm trying to complete the program without a big main plan devided in smaller parts and organized steps. I need to take a step back and make a plan of what needs to be done, when and how.*

That means that the whole progress freezes for a while, but doesn't stop entirely. Since I don't want to let you wait without a certain update date, I'll update this form again in a couple of weeks. Anything that happens regarding the project until then will be posted here.

### Update #3, Monday 15/6/2020 (game status)

I safely recovered the whole project from my dead desktop and stored it in multiple storage devices and cloud. Updated every piece of software I need to develop the Overlord so everything is fresh and clean.

The Overlord's development took a step further. Now the Overlord knows when SE1 runs and lets us know.

This step brings so many new options to the table. Things the old Spotter had and we need back. 

Other things that happened:
- As you may have noticed, the light/dark theme button's size changed. Wow..
- The greatest things though, happened where you cannot see: I revised and reworked many lines of code so things run better and future code studying and debugging is easier.
- I made clear what the program needs, how to make it happen, and in what order. So the development goes smoother and more organized.

I'll slowly continue the development through the uni semester that's attacking. It's going to take a while because the last OS my professors laid their hands on was the mighty MS DOS. Thank you for keeping up with me.
