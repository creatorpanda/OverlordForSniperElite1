# Overlord For Sniper Elite 1
An attempt to recreate a stable and self-sustainable version of the [legendary **Spotter for Sniper Elite**](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Legendary%20Spotter.png) from scratch.

### A journal where I record the progress of my biggest, most complicated project ever.

**Warning:** *I won't upload the program's code throughout the process. I don't know if I ever will or not. This is just the official page where someone can find information for the Overlord in case I ever manage to publish a functional piece of software. All the downloads, upgrades, updates and news regarding everything that concerns the proejct will be posted here.*

### ***next README.md update in less than 9 hours.***
#### To be announced:
- ~Overlord's abilities I've accomplished so far.~
- ~Overlord's abilities I'm currently working on.~
- ~Overlord's overall abilities.~

*will eventually do*

### Update #1, Wednesday 29/4/2020 (delayed cause I couldn't stop sleeping all day) 

I've been working on the Overlord for some days. Mostly studying IP harvesting and manipulation. Currently, the Overlord looks like this:

Things I'll try to finish until next update

- [x] complete Interface (only "Main Display" for now)

- [ ] saving IPs in logs

- [ ] proper actions when X button is pressed

- [ ] proper events log functionality

- [ ] proper event log export (including usernames and banned usernames for now)

(ticking things when done, before the next update)

### ***next README.md update at 06/05/2020 (dd/mm/yyyy)***
