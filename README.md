# Overlord For Sniper Elite 1
An attempt to recreate a stable and self-sustainable version of the [legendary **Spotter for Sniper Elite**](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Legendary%20Spotter.png) from scratch.

### A journal where I record the progress of my biggest, most complicated project ever.

**Warning:** *I won't upload the program's code throughout the process. I don't know if I ever will or not. This is just the official page where someone can find information for the Overlord in case I ever manage to publish a functional piece of software. All the downloads, upgrades, updates and news regarding everything that concerns the proejct will be posted here.*

#### ***next README.md update in less than 9 hours.***
~#### To be announced:~
- ~Overlord's abilities I've accomplished so far.~
- ~Overlord's abilities I'm currently working on.~
- ~Overlord's overall abilities.~

*will eventually do*

### Update #1, Wednesday 29/4/2020 (delayed cause I couldn't stop sleeping all day) 

I've been working on the Overlord for some days. Mostly studying IP harvesting and manipulation. Currently, the Overlord looks like this:

![Overlord for Sniper Elite 1](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1/blob/master/pics/Overlord3.png)

Things I'll try to finish until next update

- [x] complete Interface (only "Main Display" for now)

- [x] carefully create variables for software needs.  

- ~[ ] saving IPs in logs~

- ~[ ] proper actions when X button is pressed~

- ~[ ] proper events log functionality~

- ~[ ] proper event log export (including usernames and banned usernames for now)~

(ticking things when done, before the next update)

### Update #2, Wednesday 6/5/2020 (disappointing)
(**R.I.P. [Florian Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Schneider)**) 

I made no important progress. It's going to take a while until I'm ready to continue on the IP matter. I finished the "Main Display" GUI, all the variables needed, and now I'm focusing on the network capabilities of the program. I believe unless I finish that, nothing else can be accomplished. Finally, created a dark mode because I enjoy dark-themed programs. I like it, but it doesn't serve the main purpose of the Overlord. Here's what I made:

*I have no plans until the next update. I'll use some quality time to study what i need to learn before I continue.*
Quarantine makes everything difficult + semester is coming. Pray for me.

### Update #3, Sunday 31/5/2020 (where I've been)

It's been a while since the date I was supposed to report my progress and even more since the last update.
Truth is that studying for uni (business and tourism management) and other courses I've taken, monopolize my time.
Plus, my 11 years old desktop eventually became unreliable. Most probably a motherboard malfunction caused by corrosion that messes up RAM slots. That of course ruins stability and proper functioning of the machine, so I decided to put my desktop to rest and only use my laptop from now on. The **Overlord for Sniper Elite 1** project is safely waiting for me to extract it, in one of the desktop's drives.

That means that the whole progress freezes for a while, but doesn't stop entirely. Since I don't want to let you wait without a certain update date, I'll update this form again in a couple of weeks. Anything that happens regarding the project until then will be posted here.
